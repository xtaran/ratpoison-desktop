abe-desktop (8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * abe-laptop-ubuntu: Also provide apmd. Ubuntu metapackages depend a lot

      Depends and add an alternative dependency on system-log-daemon.
    + Conflict with and provide debconf-i18n again to get rid of
      it. Depend on debconf (>= 1.5.39) | debconf-english to have
      debconf-english installed when debconf needs either debconf-i18n or
      debconf-english.
  * abe-commandline:
