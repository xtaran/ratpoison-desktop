abe-desktop (8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * abe-laptop-ubuntu: Also provide apmd. Ubuntu metapackages depend a lot
    on it, but isn't of any use. Make conflict with apmd in abe-laptop
    versioned, so it doesn't catch the metapackages which provide
    apmd. Silence lintian arguing about this.
  * Replace fuser by psmisc (fuser is no package but part of psmisc)
  * abe-commandline now pulls in ncurses-term for consistent $TERM
    variables inside screen (c.f. #694178). abe-desktop-common suggests
    it, too.
  * abe-laptop suggests sm.
  * abe-desktop: Pull in an X display manager preferably wdm or xdm

      more complete vim can be installed.)

      syslog daemons instead. Promote busybox-syslogd from Recommends to
      Depends and add an alternative dependency on system-log-daemon.
    + Conflict with and provide debconf-i18n again to get rid of
      it. Depend on debconf (>= 1.5.39) | debconf-english to have
      debconf-english installed when debconf needs either debconf-i18n or
      debconf-english.
  * abe-commandline:
    + Suggest chiark-scripts (for random-word) or polygen
